## Research Objectives

### Research Objectives
The stretch reflex operates as a negative feedback loop to maintain muscle length at the specific value specified by the descending motor pathway to accomplish a specific movement. The movement is initiated by activity in alpha motor neurons that innervate the appropriate fiber groups in the muscle. As conditions change during the action, in this case beer is added to the mug making it heavier, sensory afferents detect the unexpected stretching of the muscle fibers. Signals from these afferents are sent to the cord where they modify the activities of the motor neuron pool to adjust the muscle force required to successfully carry out the movement.
 
## Research Objectives
The sensory signal for the stretch reflex originates in specialized structures called muscle spindles. Each muscle spindle is composed of 8 to 10 modified muscle fibers called intrafusal fibers. The muscle spindles are embedded within the muscle and are aligned parallel to the muscle fibers. The afferent sensory fibers are coiled around the central part of the spindle and are activated via stretch-sensitive ion channels when the muscle fibers stretch. The sensory fibers encode changes in muscle length and velocity by changing their action potential firing rates. 
 
## Research Objectives
This cartoon depicts the sequential events that occur when the stretch reflex is activated. This reflex induces rapid changes in muscle tension that are required to execute smooth movements. Interestingly, because the muscle spindles are modified muscle fibers, they are able to adjust the sensitivity of the reflex to match the muscle adjustments required in different situations. For example, the gain of this reflex would be increased when standing on a moving bus to compensate for starts and stops of the bus to prevent falling over, and would be lowered when standing on an elevator.
 
## Research Objectives
A slightly more complicated reflex circuit is depicted here. The flexion crossed-extension reflex involves coordinated bilateral activation of opposing muscle groups. This reflex circuit is triggered by activation of sensory receptors that are not located within the muscles themselves. The flexion reflex is a multi-synaptic circuit that permits rapid withdrawal of limbs from sudden painful stimuli. In this example, stimulation of nociceptive sensory fibers in the right foot leads to contraction of right flexor muscles and inhibition of the right extensor muscles. This flexion response is accompanied by the crossed-extension reflex in the left leg. Activation of the extensor muscle in the left leg allows us to maintain balance during withdrawal of the right leg from the painful stimulus. 
Our movements are not just a compilation of reflexes. For example, if we accidently touch a hot surface with our hand we quickly withdraw our hand from the surface. However, if heat starts to come through oven mitts when we remove hot dishes from the oven, we try not to reflexively drop the dish; instead, we run to the counter to put the dish down.
 
## Research Objectives
Central pattern generators can be defined as intrinsic spinal processors that correct imperfect sensory feedback and adapt input from higher cortical areas to optimize movement. Humans possess a central pattern generator for locomotion that is capable not only of rhythmic pattern generation but is also remarkably adaptable. These neural networks are distributed throughout the lower thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord and continue to drive motor movements even in the absence of cortical input. There are also central pattern generators that help to control rhythmic movements of the tongue, swallowing, chewing, and respiration.
Although the theory of central pattern generation calls for basic rhythmicity and patterning to be centrally generated, CPGs can respond to sensory feedback to alter the patterning in behaviorally appropriate ways. Alteration of the intrinsic motor pattern is difficult because feedback received during only one phase of the movement may require changes in movements in the other parts of the patterned cycle to preserve coordination of the movement. For example, walking with a pebble in the right shoe alters the entire gait, even though the stimulus is only present while standing on the right foot. Even during the time when the left foot is down and the sensory feedback is inactive, action is taken to prolong the right leg swing and extend the time on the left foot, leading to limping.
