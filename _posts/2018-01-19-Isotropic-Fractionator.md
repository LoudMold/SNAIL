## Research Objectives
Developing a novel, fast, and inexpensive method to quantify total numbers of neuronal and non-neuronal cells in the brain or any dissectible regions.

## Scope of the thesis work
Dr. Suzana Herculano-Houzel first summarized that Stereological methods such as the optical dissector and fractionator estimates the number of cells and neurons in discrete brain regions by multiplying cell density by volume. Because of the numbers obtained are not independent, they cannot be used in statistical comparisons against volume. Then, Dr. Herculano-Houzel and his colleagues developed a novel method that can be applied to the whole brain or any dissectible region that will offer a more accurate and quantitative numbers.

## Research Methodology
#### Steps:
1.	“Slice” preserved Brain
2.	“Stir” (Homogenize + Centrifugate)
3.	DAPI (DNA dye) Stain
4.	“Pour” homogenate + DAPI  into Vat in a isotropic suspension
5.	Extract (8+) aliquots
6.	Count with hemocytometer ( = microscope counting) - Total Cell # = Nuclei Density * Volume
7.	Add NeuN specific Antigen (Mark Neurons)
8.	Count “Neurons” (NeuN+) - Glia Cell # = Total Cell# - # of NeuN+


#### Benefits:
To achieve absolute, acute, quantitative count of Neurons, Glia. Less room of human error. It can used to analyze whole brain not just slices or regions. It yields absolute cell count independent of brain volume.

## Findings
* Rat Brain: 	
	1. Total of about 331.65 million cells
	2. 60% are Neurons -> More Neurons than Glia.
	3. No correlation between brain weights and cell.
	4. Cerebellum has 70% of Neurons, 5 times as the Cortex.
* Human Brain: 	
	1. 86 +/- 8 billion NeuN+ (Neurons) and about 84.6 billion Glia.
	2. More Neurons than Glia
	3. Cerebral Cortex contains just 19% of neurons despite size and mass.
	4. Cerebellum has just 10% of brain mass, but 69 billion (80%) neurons.
