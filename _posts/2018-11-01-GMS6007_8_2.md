# Broca’s aphasia

Paul Broca is best known for his research on **language production**. He provided the _**first**_ <u>anatomical proof that specific brain functions are localized to specific areas within the brain.</u> He proposed and obtained clinical data that the area of the brain involved in the production of speech is located in the **ventro-posterior region of the frontal lobe**. One of his first patients exhibited a progressive loss of **speech and motor function** over 21 years but did not exhibit a loss of **language comprehension**. The only word he could clearly speak was “tan” so he became known as “Tan”. Examination of the Tan’s brain revealed that he did, in fact, have a lesion in the **frontal lobe next to the lateral sulcus of the left cerebral hemisphere, the area that became known as Broca’s area. Persons with lesions of Broca’s area exhibit expressive aphasia which involves impairment of speech output.
The video of a patient with Broca’s aphasia clearly demonstrates that the patient can understand the questions being asked about his legs but cannot put together the words to answer the questions.
